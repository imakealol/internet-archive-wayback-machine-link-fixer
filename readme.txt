Automatically fix broken links by replacing them with archived versions from the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine.

== Description ==

**Internet Archive Wayback Machine Link Fixer** is a WordPress plugin designed to combat **link rot**—the gradual decay of web links as pages are moved, changed, or taken down. It automatically scans your post content—on save and across existing posts—to detect outbound links. For each one, it checks the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine for an archived version and creates a snapshot if one isn't available.

When a linked page disappears, the plugin helps preserve your user experience by redirecting visitors to a reliable archived version. It also works proactively by archiving your own posts every time they're updated, creating a consistent backup of your content's history.

Protect your links, preserve your content, and automate the archiving process—all with minimal effort.

* Helps maintain long-term content reliability and SEO

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does the link checker work? =
Your content is checked for any links. When it finds a link it will check if we have already handled this link before, if not, it will find or create a snapshot of the webpage on the Internet Archive.
Then if later that link's target site goes offline, we can change the link to the archived version.

= How do we determine if a link is broken? =
We use a similar policy as Wikipedia. We check links once per week and if we get 3 consecutive errors, we treat the link as broken, unless the target website comes back.

= Can all links be handled? =
Sadly not, some sites do not allow the Internet Archive to archive their content.

= Is my own content archived? =
Yes, you can enable the Auto Archiver and this will create new snapshots every time you make changes.

= What happens to broken links? =
When we find a broken link, we update the src on the fly; this means the base content is not edited and remains as created.

= Why is a working link being reported as broken? =
Some websites block automated bots, so the checker can receive a "403 Forbidden" and flag the link as broken even though it works fine in a browser. If this happens you can exclude that single link from its report page, or add a URL rule (with a * wildcard) to the Link Exclusions setting to cover a whole domain.

= How long does this take? =
This all depends on how many links there are within your content. This is all handled in the background but can take many weeks if a site has thousands of links. It is best used as a tool you setup and leave running in the background.

= Does this add lots of overhead to my site? =
As this is all processed behind the scenes, in custom tables it should not add any noticeable overhead to your site.

= Do I need an archive.org api key? =
While you don't need one, it will greatly increase the number of snapshots you can create in a day.

= What happens if the Internet Archive goes offline? =
If the Internet Archive services go offline, the link fixer will delay all processes by 24 hours and try again later.

= How often are my own posts updated when auto archive is active? =
Existing content is sent to the Wayback Machine in batch when the plugin is activated, then again every 30 days (by default, but can be changed). New content is sent to be archived shortly after it is published. Updates to existing content also trigger updates to be sent to the Wayback Machine.

= Multisite Compatible? =
Sadly at present, it is not fully compatible. The only way it can currently be used on multisite is to only enable it site-wide and not network-wide. We plan to resolve this in a future release.

= Page builder plugins and custom fields support? =
Right now the plugin works best with the core block editor and we have some more work to do to support page builder plugins and custom fields.

== External Services ==

This plugin connects to external services provided by the Internet Archive to provide its core functionality. The following information details what data is sent, when, and why:

= Internet Archive Wayback Machine API (web.archive.org) =

**What the service is and what it is used for:**
The Internet Archive Wayback Machine is a digital archive of the World Wide Web. This plugin uses their API to check for existing archived versions of web pages, create new snapshots of pages, and verify the status of archiving jobs.

**What data is sent and when:**

- **System Status Check**: No personal data is sent. Used to verify if the Wayback Machine service is online.
- **User Account Validation**: When you configure an API key, your access key and secret key are sent in the Authorization header to validate your account and retrieve usage statistics (available snapshots, daily limits, etc.).
- **URL Archiving**: URLs from your website content are sent to create new snapshots in the Wayback Machine. This includes both external links found in your content and your own post URLs when auto-archiving is enabled.
- **Snapshot Status Checks**: Job IDs are sent to check the status of archiving requests.
- **Existing Snapshot Lookups**: URLs are sent to search for existing archived versions of web pages.

**Service Terms and Privacy Policy:**

- Privacy Policy: [https://archive.org/about/privacy.php](https://archive.org/about/privacy.php)

= Internet Archive Bot API (iabot-api.archive.org) =

**What the service is and what it is used for:**
This service checks if web pages are accessible and retrieves final URLs after redirects. It's used to determine if links are broken and need to be replaced with archived versions.

**What data is sent and when:**

- **Link Accessibility Checks**: URLs from your website content are sent to check if they are accessible and to get the final destination URL after any redirects.
- **Impersonation Parameter**: A technical parameter (`impersonate=1`) is sent to ensure proper link checking behavior.

- Privacy Policy: [https://archive.org/about/privacy.php](https://archive.org/about/privacy.php)

**Data Retention and Privacy:**
The Internet Archive is a non-profit organization dedicated to preserving digital content for public access. URLs sent to these services become part of the public archive and may be accessible through the Wayback Machine interface. No personal information beyond the URLs themselves is transmitted to these services.
